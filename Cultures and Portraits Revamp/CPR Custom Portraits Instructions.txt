INTRODVCTION
================================================

CPR comes with a number of custom portraits. These are generally unused in game, but provided for the player in case they don't like the existing portraits. If you want a certain combination, feel free to make a request in the CPR thread!

Currently, the following custom portrait sets (and their respective custom cultures in-game) are available:

- chinesegfx (Azn): Asian appearance with East Asian clothes and hair
- commiegfx (Commie): Western appearance with Russian clothes and hair
- otakugfx (Otaku): Celtic appearance with East Asian clothes and hair
- urzhailculturegfx (Urzhailian): Western appearance with Greek clothes and hair

Please note that some of these portrait sets may be available already with some mod combinations, though generally they're unavailable for most combinations.

Please also note that some other commonly requested combinations could already be used in-game; for instance, Western appearance with Iberian clothes and hair is already used as basquegfx for the Basques, Visigoths, and Suebi.

HOW TO ADD TO YOVR GAME
================================================

There are two easy ways to use the custom portrait sets (there are in fact other ways, but these two are simple). Note that if you replacement method, you have to do this every time you install a new version of HIP.

For example's sake, the instructions will use urzhailculturegfx as our example, where we want use it to replace the existing Greek portraits (byzantinegfx).

Before you begin, ALWAYS MAKE A BACK-UP OF YOUR FILES!


Ruler Designer Method
1. When you start a new game, ruler design a character
2. In the first ruler designer screen, change the ethnicity of your character to the desired one, for instance, Urzhailian for urzhailculture.
3. And voila, you're done. Unfortunately, only you will have this new appearance, and not anyone else; however, this is the safest method not requiring you to mess with the code.

Culture Replacement Method:
1. Go to "mod\Historical Immersion Project\common\cultures" and open up the relevant culture file(s) with notepad++, notepad, or a similar program. Usually this is "00_cultures.txt" though depending on your mod combos there may be other text files you'll have to look for.
2. Since we're replacing byzantinegfx, find every instance of "byzantinegfx" and replace it with "urzhailculturegfx".
3. And voila, you're done. Every culture you've replaced will now use urzhailculturegfx.


Notes:
- You can follow these instructions to replace any portrait sets with other ones.
- If you use the ruler designer method, remember that the clothing you wear is dependent on your actual culture, not your ethnicity. So if you design a ruler with Ethiopian ethnicity but Persian culture, he will wear Persian clothes even though he has Ethiopian looks and hair.
- You could in theory also ruler design characters of the custom cultures, though they have no features so I dunno why you'd do that other for the lulz.
