INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

Thanks for downloading CPR. The current version of CPR is 3.0.0.

CPR is a portrait mod that tries to enhance portraits (obviously) by re-using and re-mixing vanilla and DLC portrait material.


Make sure HIP is installed.
To install, place folder  'Cultures and Portraits Revamp'  in:   
\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\modules\

Run the HIP installer again. Make sure you type yes for CPR.
