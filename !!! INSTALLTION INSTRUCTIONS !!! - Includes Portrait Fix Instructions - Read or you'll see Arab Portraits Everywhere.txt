INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

Thanks for downloading CPR. The current version of CPR is 2.0.2.

CPR is a portrait mod that tries to enhance portraits (obviously) by re-using and re-mixing vanilla and DLC portrait material. As such, it fills in the gap between smaller portrait mods such as the Portrait Realignment Pack that fix things but don't add a lot of new portraits, and big portrait mods such as Crakd's stuff and BLC that has entirely new art assets to create new portrait styles.

To install, simply unzip the mod into your mod folder. Further instructions on compatching and customization options are included in their respective folders.

If you DO NOT have ALL portrait DLCs, please follow the instructions below, or else you might see black or empty portraits all over the place.
