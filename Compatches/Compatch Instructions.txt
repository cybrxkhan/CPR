COMPATCH INFORMATION
==========================

These compatches are for players who want to use CPR with other mods. Please note if you are using the Immersion module of VIET that CPR is already integrated into it.

Currently, there are compatches for the following mods:

- PB (Project Balance WITHOUT SWMH)
- PB+SWMH and SWMH (will work for both)

Feel free to request compatches for other mods in the CPR thread.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

First, make sure you know what compatch you're using - the PB compatch will obviously not work with CKII+!

If you have ALL Portrait DLCs, follow the instructions below. If not, follow the instructions on the bottom instead.

1. Go to "mod/Cultures and Portraits Revamp/common/cultures."
2. Copy and paste the file from the compatch folder into this "cultures" folder you just opened up. Replace if necessary.
3. You should be good to go!



If you do NOT have ALL the Portrait DLCs, follow these instructions instead. (They are also in the main readme, but are reproduced here for your convenience.)

1. Go to "Cultures and Portraits Revamp/common/cultures" and delete "00_cultures.txt".
2. Go to "Cultures and Portraits Revamp/Interface" and delete the following files:

portrait_sprites_DLC.gfx
portraits_mediterranean.gfx
portraits_norse.gfx
portraits_persian.gfx
portraits_saxon.gfx
portraits_turkish.gfx
portraits_ugric.gfx
portraits_westernslavic.gfx
province_new.gfx

3. Go to "Cultures and Portraits Revamp/common/graphicalculturetypes" and delete "00_graphicalculturetype.txt"

4. That should be it.
